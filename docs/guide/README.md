# Introduction
VueSock is a Vue wrapper for GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). It's heavily inspired by the [react-gsap](https://bitworking.github.io/react-gsap/) library for React. 

## About GSAP
GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is a set of some JavaScript functions which let you tween a value/attribute/css property over time and insert these tweens into a timeline for more complex animations.

react-gsap just adds some React wrapper components for these functions, so also read the official GreenSock documentation to know how to do things:
