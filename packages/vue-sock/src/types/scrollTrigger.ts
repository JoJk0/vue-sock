That's caused by the fact that most modern browsers handle scroll repaints on a separate thread, so at the moment of pinning the browser may have already painted the pre-pinned content, making it visible for perhaps 1/60th of a second. The only way to counteract that is to have ScrollTrigger monitor the scroll velocity and anticipate the pin, applying it slightly early to avoid that flash of unpinned content. A value of `anticipatePin: 1` is typically fine, but you can reduce or increase that number to control how early it does the pinning. In many cases, however, you don't need any `anticipatePin` (the default is `0`). */

     * 
     * @Warning if you have CSS rules that rely on specific nesting that'd be affected by the reparenting, they'll break. For example, a CSS rule like `.section .panel p {color: white}` wouldn't apply to the nested `<p>` anymore if you pin the `.panel` element with `pinReparent: true` because during the pin, it would no longer be inside the `<section>`, so make sure you write your CSS rules to accommodate the reparenting.

If you'd rather it use margin instead of padding, you can set `pinSpacing: "margin"`. 
     * @Note pinSpacing works in most cases, but it really depends on the way you set up your DOM and CSS. For example, if you pin something in a parent that has display: flex or position: absolute, the extra padding won't push other elements down/right so you may need to manually space things out. pinSpacing is just a convenience that works in most situations.
